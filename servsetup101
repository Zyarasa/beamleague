The ServerConfig File
The server config, which is a file called ServerConfig.toml, uses the TOML format. (NOTE: The old server config file was called Server.cfg, but this is no longer used, and the server will warn when this is still present. Please also note that the two config formats are not compatible with each other.)

The config has one section by default, called [General], which holds the following values:
 

Key	Value Type	Description
AuthKey	
AuthKey format ‘xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx’

where all x's are alphanumeric characters (numbers and letters). 

Used to identify your server with the backend. You should have gotten one while following the installation instructions.
Debug	true / false	When enabled (true), will show more messages in the log and provide more information. Enable this if you run into issues. Enabling this will drastically increase the size of the log file.
Private	true / false	When enabled (true), your server will not be shown in the server list. Anyone with the correct IP and port can still connect.
Description	Any "text"	Shown as the description of the server in the server list (if the server is public). You can use special characters to format this with colors and styles.
Name	Any “text”	Shown as the name / title of your server in the server list. You can use special characters to format this with colors and styles.
Map	A valid map location, such as '/levels/gridmap_v2/info.json'	The map your server will host. Has to be installed either by default (a list can be found below) or as a server mod.
MaxCars	Any number ≥ 1	The maximum number of cars per player. Any additional cars a player tries to spawn will be deleted instantly.
Port	1024–65535	The networking port on which the server will be accessible. For a player to connect to your server directly, they will need your IP and this port.
